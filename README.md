# cs-feedback-control

A simple control system framework that provide tools for feedback controllers such as PID controller, feedback controller, fuzzy controller

# Features

The following feedback controls are implemented:

* PID controller
* Fuzzy Controller
* Kalman Filters

The sample codes in the winform project cs-feedback-control-samples-winform-ui demonstrate the various controllers in action
